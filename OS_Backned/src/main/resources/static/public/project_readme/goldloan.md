## 🏗 Architecture

### Service Layer Architecture

This project follows a **proper layered architecture** where:
- **Controllers** handle HTTP requests/responses only
- **Services** contain all business logic, validation, and service-to-service communication
- **Repositories** handle database operations only
- **Services communicate with each other**, NOT repositories directly

#### Example Flow:
```
POST /api/loan-applications
→ LoanApplicationController
→ LoanApplicationService
  ├─→ CustomerService (NOT CustomerRepository)
  ├─→ BranchService (NOT BranchRepository)
  ├─→ LoanTermService (NOT LoanTermRepository)
  ├─→ UserService (NOT UserRepository)
  └─→ EmailService (Notification)
→ LoanApplicationRepository.save()
→ Response
```

### Key Services

1. **Independent Services** (No dependencies):
   - `BranchService` - Branch management
   - `CustomerService` - Customer management
   - `LoanTermService` - Loan term configuration

2. **Dependent Services** (Service-to-service communication):
   - `LoanApplicationService` - Central service that coordinates multiple services
   - `DocumentService` - Uses `LoanApplicationService` and `UserService`
   - `GoldDetailService` - Uses `LoanApplicationService`, auto-calculates assessed value
   - `ApplicationAuditService` - Uses `LoanApplicationService` and `UserService`
   - `ValuationReportService` - Uses `LoanApplicationService`
   - `EmailService` - Automated email notifications
